## Data files for COMM313 Final Project

* Utilizing snscrape I pulled down the timelines of 170 popular liberal accounts and 125 popular conservative accounts from the past year (March 1st, 2020-March 31st, 2021).

* I found a list of liberal and conservative accounts from Pablo Barbara's 2015 research paper, *Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together*

* I randomly sampled the liberal tweets so both corpora would be the same size

* Each corpus has approximately 10,000 tweets.

* Since the corpus was so large, I had to scrape, random sample, and clean it on my computer locally, so I uploaded the cleaned files for both the liberal and conservative coprus

* `con_final_data.csv`: 10,000 conservative tweets from 125 timelines
* `liberal_data_final.csv`: 10,000 liberal tweets from 170 timelines
