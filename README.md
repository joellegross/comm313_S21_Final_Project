## Partisan Pandemic Patterns

My final project for COMM-313, is entitled *Partisanship Pandemic Patterns*. Throughout this project, I will analyze the role of partisanship on use of pandemic language and conversation, specifically through tweets.


I was motivated to look into this topic because has been a lot of news coverage recently about how pandemic-related behaviors, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and following CDC guidelines, has been largely divided along party lines, particularly because of elite cues. As we know, Donald Trump rarely wore a mask and doubted their efficacy and Biden very much encouraged masks, social distancing guidelines, etc. A recently published political science paper called, *Partisan Pandemic: How Partisanship and Public Health Concerns Affect Individualsâ€™ Social Distancing During COVID-19* discusses how partisanship is the main indicator of whether people are likley to social distance, wear masks, and follow CDC guidelines. Ultimately, the paper has a dismal conclusion, advising that emphasizing public health concerns when mitigating the spread is unlikely to bring a swift end to the pandemic, rather a change in partisan-related pandemic behaviors is the key to a return to normalcy. 

My goal is to take this investigation one step further. Instead of looking just at how partisan behaviors are different, this research will look at how language changes between partisans on these issues. 

My research question: 

*To what extent does partisanship describe language differences on topics related to the pandemic?* 

I have three guiding hypotheses to help conduct my reseach:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Hypothesis #1: *Conservatives are more likely to discuss economic-related topics regarding the pandemic than liberals.*
* Hypothesis #2: *Liberals are more likely to discuss health-related topics, such as masks and vaccines than conservatives.*
* Hypothesis #3: *Liberals are more likely to have positive sentiment surrounding the vaccines, masks, and econmy than conservatives who are more likely to have a negative sentiment.*

A brief description of the four subfolders:

*`data` : two CSV files, one for the conservative data (con_final_data.csv) and one for the liberal data (liberal_data_final.csv)

*`data_analysis`: five analysis notebooks, a folder for images, a folder for lexicons, and a functions file

*`presentation`: a python notebook for the presentation, a functions file, a folder for graphics used in the presentation, and an images folder

*`final_data_story`: a file which has a link to my medium article where you can read the final data story!
